# GYM DATABASE DESIGN
This project focuses on how to implement a functional relational database using SQL and PHP fit for a GYM.
In this project I created tables using SQL and connected them with a frontend to make sure that they operate outside the terminal world.

The ERD for all the relevant entities and relations along with relevant SQL queries are given in report.pdf.
